# OAINet Overview

## Introduction

OAINet is a decentralized blockchain project with a unique architecture comprising three main components: nodes, clients, and trainers/miners. This network not only manages cryptocurrency transactions but also distributes computational power for training AI models.

## Main Components

### Node

The node is the central component of the OAINet network. It has several responsibilities:
- **Blockchain Management**: Nodes are responsible for creating, maintaining, and validating the blockchain.
- **Transaction Processing**: Nodes handle the verification and recording of transactions.
- **Coordination**: Nodes coordinate with each other to ensure the integrity and consistency of the blockchain and transactions.

### Client

The client is the interface for users to interact with the OAINet network. It has several functionalities:
- **Wallet Creation**: Clients can create wallets to store and manage cryptocurrency.
- **Transaction Execution**: Clients can initiate transactions, sending and receiving cryptocurrency.
- **Network Status Requests**: Clients can query the network to obtain information about the current status of the blockchain and the network.

### Trainer/Miner

The trainer/miner component is responsible for providing computational power to train AI models. These nodes can:
- **Receive Training Jobs**: Trainers/miners receive models to train from other nodes.
- **Allocate Computational Resources**: They allocate computational resources to efficiently train the models.
- **Proof of Training**: After training, they provide proof that the training was completed correctly.

## Workflow

1. **Model Submission**: A user submits an AI model to be trained to a node.
2. **Job Distribution**: The node distributes the training job to available trainers/miners in the network.
3. **Training Process**: Trainers/miners allocate computational resources to train the model.
4. **Proof of Work**: Once training is completed, trainers/miners provide proof of training.
5. **Blockchain Update**: The node records the training job and its completion on the blockchain.

## Contribution
